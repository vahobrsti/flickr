# README

I used ROR as the main framework and postgres as the database engines. 

Upcoming: 

I need to add a caching system to this application to make it fast and speedy. 
# How to run it: 

You need to have Ruby and postgres installed and cofigured. This version is still in development. Will be pushed for Herokou in production.
